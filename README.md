# -Happy-Ladybugs-algo
This code solves the Happy Ladybugs problem by checking whether all ladybugs of the same color can be rearranged to be next to each other. The code first checks whether any ladybug is singular (does not have a same-colored partner), and then checks whether the current setup is already valid or whether gaps can permit rearrangement in order to make all ladybugs happy.
